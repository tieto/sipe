Introduction
============

SIPE is a third-party plugin for the Pidgin/Adium/Miranda/Telepathy
multi-protocol instant messaging clients/frameworks. It implements the
extended version of SIP/SIMPLE used by various products:

    * Skype for Business

With this plugin you should be able to replace your Microsoft Office
Communicator client with Pidgin/Adium/Miranda/Telepathy.

========

The plugin has support for

    * Instant Messaging (IM)
    * Multiparty chat (OCS 2005) or conference (OCS 2007+)
    * Group chat (Lync 2010) or Persistent chat (Lync 2013) - [MS-XCCOSIP]

    * NTLMv2, Kerberos & TLS-DSK authentication methods
    * Single Sign-On (depends on OS and authentication method)
    * Automatic SSL/TLS protection for SIP/HTTP connections
    * Crypto implementation using NSS or OpenSSL
    * Localization

The plugin has backends for

    * Pidgin/Finch (libpurple)
    * Adium (libpurple)

Advantages over Office Communicator products
============================================

    * Available on broader range of platforms: Linux, *BSD, Maemo, OSX,
      commercial UNIX, Windows.
    * Ability to simultaneously connect to several Office Communicator
      accounts in addition to public IM network accounts like MSN, AOL,
      Yahoo. For example one account is in vendor company and another is
      in client company.
    * Keeps history of communications in environments without Outlook. For
      example in companies where Lotus Notes is deployed as a default
      groupware client instead of Outlook.
    * Lotus Notes/Domino calendar integration. Unique to SIPE.
    * Open development model, open source product. License is GPLv2+


Support
=======

The Pidgin or Adium projects do not support third-party plugins! Please do
not ask questions about SIPE in their forums or report SIPE problems to their
bug trackers.

If you set up your Office Communicator/Lync account with SIPE for the first
time then please make sure to read this page:

    https://sourceforge.net/p/sipe/wiki/How%20to%20setup%20an%20account/

If you encounter problems then please make sure to check out the Frequently
Asked Question page:

    https://sourceforge.net/p/sipe/wiki/faq/

If you still have problems then please check the support forum if another
user encountered the same problem and maybe solved it already:

    http://sourceforge.net/p/sipe/discussion/

If you think that you have found a bug in SIPE then please report it to the
SIPE bug tracker:

    https://sourceforge.net/p/sipe/bugs/

The SIPE project kindly requests that you do not ignore the instructions that
appear at the head of the "Create Ticket" page. These instructions are there
for a reason and if you ignore them then you will only cause unnecessary work
for the project and yourself. Please do not report missing features as bugs.

New or missing features can be requested here:

    https://sourceforge.net/p/sipe/feature-requests/


Localization
============

SIPE has already been localized for several languages. You can help to
translate SIPE to your native language at Transifex:

    https://www.transifex.com/stefanb/pidgin-sipe/

The service offers a convenient web editor.


Installing from a distribution repository
=========================================

Many Open Source OS distributions have a ready-made package "pidgin-sipe".
Before trying to compile it from the source code yourself, you should try
to install this package with the standard installation method provided by
your OS.


Do It Yourself I: compiling against "pidgin" package
====================================================

NOTE: for instructions how to setup a build environment on Windows to
      compile the Windows Pidgin plugin, please read:

	https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/BuildingWinPidgin

NOTE: for instructions how to cross-compile the Windows Pidgin plugin on
      Linux, please read:

	contrib/mingw-cross-compile/README.txt

NOTE: for instructions how to compile the SIPEAdiumPlugin on Mac OS X,
      please read:

	src/adium/README.adium


If you already have installed the "pidgin" package from your distribution
repository and want compile SIPE from source code yourself, then you need to
install the necessary headers first. Depending on your distribution you'll
need to install one of the following packages

	libpurple-dev
	libpurple-devel

For the compilation you'll need to install a C compiler and some of the
following packages

	libtool
	intltool

	pkg-config
	libglib2.0-dev
	libxml2-dev
	libgmime-2.4-dev  (optional)
	libgmime-2.6-dev  (optional)

	pkgconfig
	libglib2-devel
	libxml2-devel
	gettext-devel
	gmime-devel       (optional)

You have to choose between NSS or OpenSSL for the crypto backend. You'll
need one of the following packages

	for NSS:
	libnss3-dev
	nss-devel
	mozilla-nss-devel

	for OpenSSL:
	libssl-dev
	openssl-devel

If you want to enable Kerberos authentication support then you'll need one
of the following packages

	libkrb5-dev
	krb5-devel

If you additionally want to disable the internal NTLM implementation and
authenticate with NTLM via GSSAPI then you'll need one of the following
packages

	gssntlmssp-devel

If you want to enable Voice & Video features then you'll need some of the
following packages

	libnice-dev           (>= 0.1.0)
	libgstreamer0.10-dev

	libnice-devel         (>= 0.1.0)
	gstreamer-devel

Now you should be able to compile the source code with

	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make

If you get errors then you are missing some required package. After
successful compilation you can install SIPE with:

	su -c "make install"

If you get errors from configure or libtool about version conflicts then
you need to regenerate the autoconf files. You'll need these additional
packages

	autoconf
	automake

Now you should be able to regenerate the files with

	autoreconf --verbose --install --force

After that go back to the configure step above.


Do It Yourself II: compiling against self-compiled pidgin
=========================================================

If you have compiled pidgin from source code yourself then you'll have to
specify the correct installation path in configure. Usually pidgin is
installed in /usr/local so the following command should work

	./configure --prefix=/usr/local

The rest of the steps are the same as in the previous section.
